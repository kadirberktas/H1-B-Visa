People are generally choosing east side but WHY?

If we base LA for west side and NYC for east side;

LA vs. NYC Real Estate Prices
The biggest elephant in the room these days is the price of real estate, and we’ll be honest. It should be. Though both cities are notoriously expensive, living in LA vs NYC means that you will save a pretty penny on your home. 

The average price of a house in NYC is around $1 million. In Los Angeles, the price of a house goes for around $660,000. While most parts of the country would balk at either, it’s clear that buying a home in the Big Apple is a far more difficult task. 

Verdict: Los Angeles is cheaper than NYC. 

LA vs. NYC Weather
New York City has four seasons that can range from the bitter cold to the swelteringly hot. That makes it a great place for people who want to experience snow, sun, and a little bit of spring and fall too. Though it has inclement weather, wildfires and earthquakes don’t really happen here.

Los Angeles, for the most part, is famous for its perfect Mediterranean weather. It’s almost always sunny, the temperatures don’t fluctuate too much, and it’s always a good time for the beach. The problems here, though, are earthquakes and wildfires. So, it’s a tradeoff.

Verdict: Los Angeles takes this hands down. It's hard to beat the incredible LA climate. 

LA vs. NYC Job Market
When it comes to the vast majority of glitzy, high-paying jobs, you’ll find that they’re centered around each coast. East Coast jobs are mainly in finance, West Coast jobs tend to be in entertainment. But, things are changing and now we’re seeing a lot more people traveling from coast to coast. 

In terms of salaries, NYC has more high-paying jobs, but the cost of living is much higher compared to LA. 

Verdict: It depends on your situation, but NYC jobs tend to pay better. However, industry matters a lot as well. If you're in tech LA might be better, while if you're an investment banker, NYC would be the logical choice.

LA vs. NYC Crime Rates
Though New York City used to be known for having a decent amount of crime, the actual statistics paint a different story. Crime in the city has been on a downward trend since the 90s, and NYC is now considered one of the safest cities of its size. It should be noted that in recent years crime has slightly risen, mostly due to the overall incompetence of mayor de Blasio and his administration. 

Los Angeles, on the other hand, has a crime problem. The city has a higher murder rate than New York, and also reports higher rates of robberies, vandalism, and assaults. With that said, LAPD has been working hard at clamping down on crime.

Verdict: New York is safer and will only get safer now that Bill de Blasio is out of office.

Actually It depends what style life you want. I mean In my opinion LA best fit for me but that's for me. Because of my life style. 


Maybe because of the salaries? Lets see;

We can see, US need to employee for their tech sector.

Those companies are sponsoring employee from different country's person. And that is graph.

VERDICT:

That is your choice which side you re gonna live in US but i am sure you are gonna get high salaries in there. But east side higher salary than west side. And US really need to employee for growing but for their tech sector. If you are really good at your major especially tech sector, you could easily find job and get H1-B visa. So you can live dream country like US. They are really open for that. 

Thanks for timing, see you next analysis..
